# Responsive Fretboard (In progress)

A jQuery plugin for displaying a responsive, interactive, configurable, stylable fretboard of any number of frets, strings, and tunings. I also have this wrapped as an AngularJS directive.

I initially wrote this so I could capture user input (chords/scales) and display chords/scales of my own. I am developing features as I need them, but if you have a feature request feel free to contact me.



## Demo
Check out my voice leading page, where I use the fretboard to help users create progressions with good voice leading:
